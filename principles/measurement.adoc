= Measurement

How can we know if a software project is going well?

The answer is to measure it. We need to gather data on the project's progress
and use that data to make decisions about how to proceed.

This playbook RECOMMENDS that data be gathered from a variety of sources,
including:

* link:../practices/team-health-checks.adoc[Team health checks]
* Customer feedback
* Artifacts such as link:../artifacts/changelogs.adoc[changelogs]

It is also RECOMMENDED that system metrics, such as performance and uptime, also
be monitored to measure the evolving quality of the software product. However,
observability is a technical concern and is not therefore covered by this
playbook. And other data sources not covered in this playbook, such as financial
data and market research, may also be relevant.
