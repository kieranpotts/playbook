= Measurement

How can we know if a software project is going well?

The answer is to measure it.

This playbook RECOMMENDS that data be gathered from a variety of sources,
including:

* link:../artifacts/system-metrics.adoc[System metrics]
* link:../artifacts/delivery-metrics.adoc[Delivery metrics]
* link:../practices/team-surveys.adoc[Team surveys]
* link:../practices/user-surveys.adoc[User surveys]

These each provide a different perspective on a software project. For example,
system metrics and user surveys provide insight into the quality of the software
product, while delivery metrics and team surveys provide more insight into the
effectiveness of the software delivery process.

Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive view of the direction of the
software project – if it is on a path to success, or otherwise – and help to
identify areas where things could be improved.
