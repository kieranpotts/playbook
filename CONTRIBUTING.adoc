= How to contribute to this playbook

Anyone with write access to this repository can contribute changes to this
playbook using the normal source control workflow.

Everyone is encouraged to keep this playbook up-to-date, and to continuously
improve the quality of its content. As with any living documentation, the more
people involved in its upkeep, the more valuable the documentation will become.

== Guidelines

The following guidelines will help you to contribute good quality content to
this playbook:

* *Useful*: Above all, the content of the playbook must be useful. Documentation
  should be written in plain language and simple sentences. Jargon should be
  avoided where possible, and explained where it is necessary. Use examples for
  illustration, and provide links to related reference material.

* *Discoverable*: It should be easy to find the content that you're looking
  for. This requires the content to be organized into an intuitive structure,
  with a clear hierarchy and minimal nesting.

* *Contextual* â€“ Organize documents around how you will use them. Think about
  what they are useful for, in which situations you will need the information,
  and put the content in that section of the playbook.

* *Reuse*: Design individual items of content to be reused, by connecting to
  them (using links) from other content. The more that information is reused,
  the more value it provides, and so the more it repays the cost of writing and
  maintaining it. To promote reusability, keep individual documents small and
  cohesive, and focused on a single concept.

* *Experiment*: Don't be afraid to experiment with the structure and content
  of the playbook. Take an iterative and incremental approach to the playbook's
  development. Add placeholders for sections you think you will need to write
  later. Start small, with the content that matters most to your team, and let
  it evolve organically.

These are the primary qualities that we should strive for when making changes to
the playbook. These qualities are more important than the content being complete,
comprehensive, or even correct. Documentation is more likely to be maintained and
updated when the content is already useful, and when it is already easy to find
what you're looking for. Remove these qualities and documentation tends to
become stale and out-of-date.
