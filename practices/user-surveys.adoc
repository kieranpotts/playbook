= User surveys

User surveys have two purposes:

* To link:../principles/measurement.adoc[measure] the _outcomes_ and _value_
  delivered for users.

* To identify the remaining pain points for users, and identify areas where
  the user experience or value delivered can be improved.

== Questions to measure value delivered

* Are you happy with what's been delivered?
* Do you believe the product delivers real value for you?
* Does the solution have a unique value proposition, something that sets it
  apart from competitors?

== Questions to discover opportunities to increase value
