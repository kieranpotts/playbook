= Prioritization

There are several possible strategies for prioritizing work. The RECOMMENDED strategy is the MoSCoW convention:

* *Must have*:
  The change should be implemented and released as soon as practically possible.

* *Should have*:
  The change is important but the timing of its release is not so important.

* *Could have*:
  A nice-to-have that doesn't add much business value.

* *Won't have*:
  The change has not been rejected outright, but it should not be implemented
  at this time.
