Team sentiment surveys are an effective method for
link:../principles/measurement.adoc[measuring] how a software project is going.

For a complete picture, a mix of quantitative and qualitative data needs to be
gathered. Quantitative data are measures of _quantities_. They are objective and
can be easily summed and analyzed. Examples of quantitative data include
how often changes are deployed to production, how long the deployment process
takes on average, and how often the deployment pipeline fails.

Qualitative data are measures of _qualities_. They are more subjective and can
therefore be harder to measure. But qualitative data help to provide a more
nuanced view. They tend to be better at identifying areas for improvement in
ways of working and other human aspects of software development. Examples of
qualitative data include observations of team dynamics, and views on the quality
of work produced by a team.

link:./technical-health-checks.adoc[Technical health checks] gather quantitative
data and specialize in measures of the quality of the software product. Team
sentiment surveys gather qualitative data and specialize in measures of team
effectiveness at delivering quality software efficiently.

For example, a technical health check might ask "how long does it take to go
from code committed to code running in production?", while the team sentiment
survey might instead ask "in your view, do you think the deployment process is
appropriate for this type of software product?"

Team sentiment surveys measure the "developer experience" â€“ the feelings and
observations of the team members working on the project. This is important
because productivity is directly related to job satisfaction and team
behaviors.

The practice of surveying software delivery teams on the "health" of their team
and projects was {link-spotify-2014}[popularized by Spotify], though the
practice is not new and has taken different forms over many decades.

Team sentiment surveys have numerous benefits, including:

* They serve as an early-warning system for projects that are steadily going
  off-course. Sentiment tends to decrease before other
  link:../artifacts/delivery-metrics.adoc[delivery metrics] such as cycle
  time start to appreciably deteriorate. Project managers can therefore
  respond early, for example by diverting resources to the team under the most
  strain.

* They supplement more objective delivery metrics, such as production incidents
  and time to recovery, by providing context and insight into _why_ these
  metrics are changing.

* They also help delivery teams themselves to be more autonomously, and to
  learn and improve. In this regard, sentiment surveys offer an alternative
  to retrospectives as a method for reflecting on what's working and what needs
  improving.

Team sentiment surveys are RECOMMENDED for organizations with two or more
technical teams, but will be beneficial for smaller organizations too. The
surveys SHOULD be implemented in a software service such as Google Sheets or
Airtable, allowing for easy analysis and visualization of the results. Team
sentiment surveys SHOULD be conducted at least once every three months, and the
results MAY be augmented with feedback from one-to-ones and other less formal
channels.

Staff should be given plenty of time to think about and respond to sentiment
surveys. And, ideally, answers will be anonymously. This will encourage more
thoughtful and more honest (and therefore more valuable) responses. The same
should be applied to [technical health checks], too.

For easier analysis, questions should be answerable with a simple "Yes", "No" or
"I don't know"; alternatively a numerical score of 1 (low) to 5 (high). However,
open-ended questions are also valuable, as they can provide more context and
insight.
