Team sentiment surveys are an effective method for
link:../principles/measurement.adoc[measuring] how a software project is going.

For a complete picture, a mix of quantitative and qualitative data needs to be
gathered. Quantitative data are measures of _quantities_. They are objective and
can be easily summed and analyzed. Examples of quantitative data include
measures of how often changes are deployed to production, how long the
deployment process takes, and how often the deployment pipeline fails.

Qualitative data are measures of _qualities_. They are more subjective and can
therefore be harder to measure. But qualitative data help to provide a more
nuanced view. They tend to be better, for example, at identifying areas for
improvement in ways of working and other _human_ aspects of software development.
Examples of qualitative data include observations of team dynamics, and views on
the quality of work produced by a team.

link:./technical-health-checks.adoc[Technical health checks] gather quantitative
data and specialize in measures of the quality of the software product. Team
sentiment surveys gather qualitative data and specialize in measures of the
effectiveness of the teams and of software delivery process.

For example, a technical health check might ask "how long does it take to go from
code committed to code running in production?", the team sentiment survey might
ask "how satisfied are you with the deployment process?"

Team sentiment surveys measure the "developer experience" â€“ the feelings and
observations of the team members working on the project. This is important
because productivity is directly related to job satisfaction and team
behaviors.
