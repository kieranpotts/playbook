= System metrics

System metrics are measures of the quality of the software product running in
production systems. They are typically generated automatically by monitoring
tools and provide an objective view of the software system's performance and
reliability.

When analyzed in combination with other link:../principals/measurements.adoc[measurements]
such as link:../practices/technical-health-checks.adoc[technical health checks],
system metrics can provide valuable insights into the evolving quality of
a software product.

It is strongly RECOMMENDED that system metrics be gathered from production
services, and monitored and tracked over time to identify trends.

However, which system metrics are most useful will depend on the nature of the
software product. Some common system metrics include uptime, response time,
error rates, and resource usage. This is a technical concern and is outside of
the scope of this playbook.
