= Software Development Methodology

Many things are needed to make a success of a software project: great leadership,
great people, strong financials, favorable market conditions, and a suitable
process. This documentation is focused on the latter.

Software development is a human-centred process, or a social activity, more
than it is a technical one. Software development is a _system_ in itself, in
the same way that organizations are systems for organizing people and resources
to achieve common goals. A software development methodology is a process or
system that organizes people and resources to deliver IT solutions for target
user groups.
