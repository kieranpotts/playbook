= Objectives

An iterative and incremental approach is taken to this playbook, too. This is
a "living document", which means it is continuously evolving as we learn from
our experiences and adapt our ways of working to the changing contexts in which
we find ourselves.

A software development playbook works best when it is treated, not as a rigid
set of rules and procedures, but as a set of continuously evolving principles
and practices that the software development teams have found, through
experience and experimentation, to be most effective.

The playbook is a shared resource, owned and maintained by the development teams,
who have collective autonomy to design their own ways of working. This resource
is intended to _empower_ teams, not _constrain_ them. The rules of the playbook
are not enforced by a central authority, but are the collective agreement of the
development teams.

The playbook thus represents the current consensus of the development teams on
the ways of working that best suit our needs.

As well as reflecting the current state of our practices, the playbook also
provides a system for evolving our practices over time. The content of the
playbook is subject to continuous improvement, and all members of the
development teams are encouraged to contribute to its upkeep â€“ which is done
via the normal source control workflows. (See the
link:../CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contributing guide] for more details.) The more
people involved in keeping our playbook up-to-date, the more valuable this
resource will be.

A good playbook enables:

* *Efficiency*. +
  It makes decision making and onboarding faster.

* *Consistency* +
  It encourages uniform practices across teams and projects.

* *Scalability* +
  It enables teams to grow and work asynchronously, by codifying knowledge
  and processes.
