= Inspiration

Nothing in this playbook is new. The principles, practices, processes, tools,
and artifacts mentioned in this playbook are all well-established in our
industry. Most of them have been around for decades, some since the very
beginning of digital computers.

The link:../references.adoc[references] section lists the resources that have
been the most influential in shaping the methods and tools documented in this
playbook.

But the particular combination of methods and tools in this playbook is formed
from our own experiences and experimentation. Inevitably, this playbook is
opinionated. It reflects our own professional values and principles, and our
own beliefs about how best to go about the business of making commercial
software.
